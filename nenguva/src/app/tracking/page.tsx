        </h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Tracking your Parcel Monkey order is easy, just use your full PM order number located on your Parcel Monkey account. 
          Enter this into the tracking tool above to see where your parcel is. You can also find it on your email confirmation 
          as well as the shipping label if you wanted to take a note before you send a parcel.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Whether you have had your item collected or dropped it off, you can use this tool to follow the parcels progress 
          through the courier network. You can share this number with the recipient too, so that they can also monitor the 
          movement of the package while it is in transit with the delivery company.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          If your item is time sensitive or due to arrive by a certain time youâ€™ll want to keep tabs on its delivery so we 
          offer tracking with all our courier services, including domestic and international.
